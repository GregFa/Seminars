While main-only (or ANCOVA) linear models are predominant, cat-modified linear models that include categorical-continuous or categorical-categorical interactions are increasingly important and allow heterogeneous, group-specific effects. However, with standard approaches, the addition of cat-modifiers fundamentally alters the estimates and interpretations of the main effects, often inflates their standard errors, and introduces significant concerns about group (e.g., racial) biases. We advocate an alternative parametrization and estimation scheme using abundance-based constraints (ABCs). ABCs induce a model parametrization that is both interpretable and equitable. Crucially, we show that with ABCs, the addition of cat-modifiers 1) leaves main effect estimates unchanged and 2) enhances their statistical power, under reasonable conditions. Thus, analysts can, and arguably should include cat-modifiers in linear regression models to discover potential heterogeneous effectsâ€”without compromising estimation, inference, and interpretability for the main effects. Using simulated data, we verify these invariance properties for estimation and inference and showcase the capabilities of ABCs to increase statistical power. We apply these tools to study demographic heterogeneities among the effects of social and environmental factors on STEM educational outcomes for children in North Carolina. An R package lmabc is available."""
